# WeekBot

A discord bot that sends a message each day containing a YouTube link to the current day of the week. 

## Setup

Before using the bot you must create a `.env` file which includes the line `DISCORD_TOKEN=` followed by a discord token.

## Usage

There aren't any real commands needed as this process runs automatically each day, however you can use the regular commands such as:

`!source` - returns a link to the source code
`!ping` - returns the latency of the discord bot
